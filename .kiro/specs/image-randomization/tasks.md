# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create image randomization utility functions





  - Implement ImageRandomizer class with shuffle and selection methods
  - Create unit tests for randomization algorithms
  - Add difficulty balancing logic to ensure good distribution
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 2. Expand the image data structure and pool





  - Add more images to existing categories (animals, objects, nature)
  - Create organized image categories structure in src/data/images.ts
  - Implement getAllImages() and getRandomGameImages() functions
  - Maintain backward compatibility with existing gameImages export
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 5.3_

- [x] 3. Create image pool management utilities




  - Implement image selection logic that handles pool size variations
  - Add error handling for insufficient images scenario
  - Create functions to validate image pool integrity
  - Write unit tests for pool management functions
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 4. Integrate randomization into game state hook
  - Modify useGameState hook to use randomized image selection on game start
  - Ensure external interface remains unchanged for existing components
  - Add internal selectedImages state management
  - Test that all existing game mechanics work with randomized images
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 5.1, 5.2, 5.4_

- [ ] 5. Add comprehensive testing for randomization feature
  - Create integration tests for complete game flow with randomized images
  - Test multiple game sessions produce different image sequences
  - Verify difficulty progression remains balanced with random selection
  - Test edge cases like insufficient image pool size
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 6. Validate preservation of existing functionality
  - Run existing game through complete flow to ensure no breaking changes
  - Test all existing components work unchanged with new image system
  - Verify scoring, progression, and user interface remain identical
  - Test game performance with larger image pool
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.4_
