# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the HyperPixation game by implementing image randomization for each game session. Currently, players see the same sequence of images every time they play, which reduces replayability. This enhancement will randomize the image order and expand the image library to provide a fresh experience on each visit.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see different images in a random order each time I play, so that the game remains challenging and engaging across multiple sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new game session starts THEN the system SHALL randomly select and shuffle images from the available image pool
2. WHEN a player completes a game and starts a new one THEN the system SHALL present a different random sequence of images
3. WHEN multiple players visit the website THEN each SHALL receive a unique randomized sequence of images

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a game administrator, I want an organized image directory system, so that I can easily manage and expand the collection of game images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are stored THEN the system SHALL organize them in a structured directory format with metadata
2. WHEN new images are added THEN the system SHALL automatically include them in the randomization pool
3. WHEN image metadata is defined THEN it SHALL include the answer, difficulty level, and image source information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to maintain the same difficulty progression, so that the experience remains balanced even with randomized images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are randomized THEN the system SHALL maintain appropriate difficulty distribution across the 10 levels
2. WHEN selecting random images THEN the system SHALL ensure a mix of difficulty levels throughout the game
3. WHEN a game session uses randomized images THEN the scoring system SHALL remain consistent with the original game mechanics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the image randomization to be performant and reliable, so that players don't experience delays or errors during gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads THEN image randomization SHALL complete within 100ms
2. WHEN images are shuffled THEN the system SHALL ensure no duplicate images appear in a single game session
3. WHEN the image pool is accessed THEN the system SHALL handle cases where fewer than 10 images are available gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve the existing game architecture and components, so that the randomization enhancement integrates seamlessly without breaking current functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing randomization THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing React components without modification to their interfaces
2. WHEN updating the image system THEN the existing GameImage interface and data structure SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN adding the image directory THEN it SHALL extend the current src/data/images.ts approach without replacing the existing pattern
4. WHEN randomization is implemented THEN all existing game mechanics, scoring, and user flows SHALL remain identical
